Hi, I'm Chad Shaffer.

I live in North County San Diego. I write software for a living.

Despite my relatively empty [Github profile][github], I am passionate about open source software.

I'm actively working to convince my current employer to allow me to make open source contributions, in the meantime, this blog will have to be where I put code.
