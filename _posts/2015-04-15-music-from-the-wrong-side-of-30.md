I was _this_ close to divorcing music. Our relationship was rocky at
best, held together by nostalgia and habit, and a far cry from the intense love
affair that blossomed 25 years prior.

I would go weeks where the only music I encountered was emanated from my
infant daughter's toys. One day as I started the commute home and dialed
up another episode of [Radiolab][radiolab] instead of DJ iPhone Shuffle,
I asked myself, "how did we get here?"

Like almost everyone else that just turned 30, the genres of music I
identified with up until now are either a mockery of themselves or in their
death throes. With nothing new to get excited about, the old stuff
starts to lose out to all of the other things demanding my attention.

I need an intervention.

Similar to my (so far) successful strategy to [up my reading
game][read-more-better], I've decided to switch gears from Metallica to
Mozart.

I can listen to classical music while I code whereas [this][backburner]
doesn't seem to live well in the background, and I'll feel a little less
weird exposing my daughter to [this][mahler] than [this][pantera], at least for
the next few years.

Unfortunately I haven't found as great of a tool to guide my musical
discoveries as I did for literature. Instead my plan is to start with a
breadth first search across 13 composers in chronological order, only
listening to their symphonies or other major works. Afterwards, I hope
to have developed a preference for a few, and will dive deeper into
their catalogs.

The composers that made the cut are:

1. Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750)
2. Franz Joseph Haydn (1732 - 1806)
3. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 - 1791)
4. Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770 - 1827)
5. Franz Peter Schubert (1797 - 1828)
6. Frederic Chopin (1810 - 1849)
7. Wilhelm Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883)
8. Giuseppe Fortunino Frencesco Verdi (1813 - 1901)
9. Johannes Brahms (1833 - 1897)
10. Gustav Mahler (1860 - 1911)
11. Achille-Claude Debussy (1862 - 1918)
12. Igor Stravinsky (1882 - 1971)
13. Aaron Copland (1900-1990)

Am I making a huge mistake by leaving your favorite composer out? Let me
know!
