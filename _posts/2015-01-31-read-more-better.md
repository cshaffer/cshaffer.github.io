I spent a lot of time reading "junk books." Like junk food, these books were
sometimes good, most of the time bad, and always unfulfilling.

Reading takes up so much free time, but it's important to stay well-rounded,
and I do enjoy it, so I decided to try to find a way to maximize my return on
investment.

If I'm going to read something, why not read the _best_ thing? In fact, why
read anything until I've already read everything better first?

But how do you decide what is the _best_ book? Well, luckily lots of smart
people read books, and they all have opinions they're willing to share.

In fact, as is the case most of the time, a fellow developer already had the
same idea and did all the work for me. The best part is, he wrote it
in Rails (high five!).

At [thegreatestbooks.org][greatest-books] you can find a list that combines
hundreds of "greatest books ever" lists. To me, this is the best way to
objectively find out what the next best book you haven't read is and go read
it.

So that's what I've been doing for a little over a year now. The site
continues to add more lists and as a result the overal rankings change every
so often. You can follow updates to the knowledge base on the accompanying
[blog][greatest-blog].

Thanks to the developer that makes this service available:
[Shane Sherman][sherman-twitter]. I'm definitely reading more and getting more
out of what I read because I don't spend weeks trying to decide what to read
next and everything is of supreme quality.
