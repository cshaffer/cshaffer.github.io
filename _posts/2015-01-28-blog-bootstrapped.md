Hello Everyone!

Welcome to the place I dump my musings.

I believe writing is a muscle and it seems to me keeping fit is a good idea,
so I will try to post something, anything, every day.

I "built" this blog using [Jekyll][jekyll] and am hosting it via
[GitHub Pages][gh-pages].

The [code][repo] is thus open source and pull requests are welcome.

[jekyll]:      http://jekyllrb.com
[gh-pages]:    https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages
[repo]:        https://github.com/cshaffer/cshaffer.github.io
